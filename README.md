# The main idea is to write an analogue of the Qt library. 
Accessible to everyone, without exception. 
Under a free license. Don't wait for new C++ standards. Add interesting functionality.

# License issues.
Please help me choose a license. I want to choose a license that allows everyone to use the code. 
Link statically to your proprietary programs, without opening the code of the main program. 
But if changes were made to the Lt library, open the changes to the community. Maybe it's LGPLv3 or Zlib license.
I'm glad for everyone. The main language for communication is English. There are no restrictions on ideas or functionality. 
Ready to discuss any questions, ideas, suggestions. There is no bureaucracy.

# Other
I'm using the C++98 standard. To support old and new platforms.
